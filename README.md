 Last-Mile-Help – Digital Identity & Services for the Invisible Citizens
Last-Mile-Help is a humanitarian platform designed to support undocumented individuals — such as homeless citizens, migrant workers, and disaster victims — by providing them with temporary digital identities and connecting them to essential services like healthcare, shelter, food, and employment.
This project aims to bridge the gap between underserved communities and service providers (NGOs, government schemes, etc.).

🧾 Upload & store essential documents securely

📄 QR code generation and scanning for easy ID access

📍 Service application: healthcare, ration, shelter, jobs

👤 Admin dashboard to view & manage registered individuals

🔐 Secure data handling with MongoDB and Express
